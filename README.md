# Anti-Afk
An Anti Afk for every game!

1. Copy the code and then paste it into an application like Eclipse (Java!)
2. For the Anti Afk it is necessary to start the executable in admin mode!

Important:
1. It can happen that the Anti Afk in game falls down somewhere or does something similar that could lead to death!
2. In order for the Anti Afk to work, it is important that the standard keys are used to move (W, A, S, D/ Space/ Shift...)!
